# metadata

Motivation:
We are looking for methods to organize and summarize our data to enable us to abide by FAIR principles and play a leading role in enabling the industry to adopt such methods during data creation, assimilation and post-processing. A lot of data in the wind energy field is related to one another and although data standards exist in meteorological domains, computational domains and SCADA data domains, they remain distributed and suit exclusively to the applications at hand. The intention here is to get inputs from the participants regarding the missing information and build a solution i.e. a metadata file which will suit a complete system e.g. a wind farm

Challenge:
What information shall be included in the metadata and where does it fit? How does a final metadata file look like and how accessible is it to the industry?

Datasets:
Any measurement sensor that applies to a wind farm or CFD codes metadata variables. I am adding a general metadata data set with four levels as an excel File. This is easier to work for many, compared to a script. Once, we are done with the Challenge, we can convert it into any requested format.

Challenge Guidelines:
We welcome inputs from everyone. Please include a link to this challenge at the top of your solution so that a link is automatically created at the bottom of this document.
Use keywords like #metadata while commenting in other groups, such that your views are traceable
Look for existing variables, before adding a new variables. Check for synonyms and suggest an improvement, if significant changes are to be implemented.
Create a new worksheet with the same structure, if a completely new System is to be implemented. This can be used as hierarchical information in netcdf / hdf5 formats
